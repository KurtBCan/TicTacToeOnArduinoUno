# TicTacToeOnArduinoUno
Microsoft Copilot generated Arduino IDE code for a two-player serial TicTacToe game on the Arduino Uno. I gifted an Arduino Uno this holiday and wanted to make some serial terminal games that could introduce them to Arduino IDE and code. Microsoft Copilot generated this code that worked no problem first try. I thought it might be interesting to share what prompt I used to get Copilot to generate this (typos and all ðŸ˜‚).
